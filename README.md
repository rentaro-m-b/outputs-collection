# outputs-collection
## Abstructs
The output, i.e. all the things created by myself, including both learning records and creations, from photographs to drawings, and I want to collect and organise these and design this anew. The important thing is not the creation of services, but the art itself, and we will attempt to build this project in accordance with the principle that action is what forms meaning. It is also meant to be a study of Rust and web applications. The implementation of login functions, query execution, logging-related implementation and testing will be essential.
